            The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive web app that can predict election results using data from social media, and general political trends, such as dark money. Initially, I started by developing an understanding of how elections work on a county and state level. I then started collecting data to use for my app. Using large-scale scraping tools, I found a large dataset of information from Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, for demographic information, I looked through census data to format data correctly and gather voting numbers. Then, I took data from campaign contributions and expenditures and dark money data. Dark money is political spending from nonprofit organizations toward political organizations, and they are not required to disclose their donors. Using Opensecrets, I was able to find dark money data and use it in my app. Then, I used the famous pandas library to manipulate and integrate my data. Using all the data from sources listed above, I had created a huge dataset which I could then filter through and use for my app and algorithm. Next was creating the algorithm. To start off, I had developed a basic algorithm in flask, which is a web framework for python that allowed me to create an interface to display our data and applications. After that, I designed an HTML template with an index page, ACS data, FEC data, and predictions. I then used chart.js to visualize the data and used a random forest algorithm, regression algorithm, and a neural network not in conjunction with each other but instead as three separate algorithms to run the data through. The app is meant to be deployed locally via browser. For visualizations, I chose a map of the US and a data table, along with other helpful state and county information. I believe that these graphs are important to implement as they are the backbone of my project that will actually be displayed, so getting these right was quite difficult. Another difficulty I had in this project was successfully gathering all the data, actively filtering out all bot accounts was impossible, so there is a small margin of error with some accounts that may be bots. In conclusion, however, I believe my project was overall successful, I have plotted it with different data against elections that have already happened and it has guessed right most of the time. Looking forward in the future, I plan to upgrade it when the next election rolls around.

            For this yearâ€™s cornerstone project, I have created a website that uses AI and social media to predict the results of elections. I wanted to do this project because I have always found politics fascinating, and with the recent surge in popularity of AI, I wanted to mix the two into a single project. In the US, elections are an important part of the democratic process, but I wanted to see how public perception of the election on the internet actually correlates to votes in real life. Additionally, I think that understanding how trends in media can influence elections is extremely important for understanding the changing world of politics. My driving question was: How do trends in media, and the overall opinion of media platforms, correlate with actual election results? I aimed to find this out by analyzing large datasets from reddit, facebook, and twitter, running them through an AI learning model, and visualizing the data, comparing it to actual elections to test for accuracy.  I found this project meaningful because it taught me so much about how people can be influenced by the media, and how seemingly small trends in social media can drastically change election results. Understanding this is crucial in the digital age, and will continue to increase in the future.
Overall, I found this project to be greatly beneficial to my learning of politics and computer science. Long hours sifting through data, understanding federal policy, and social media trends have taught me how to tackle daunting challenges, and doing this project has opened up a new area of interest for me: Politics, media, and psychology. For a future project, I would like to build on this by understanding the psychology behind elections and the media, how the two can be combined, and how they affect us as a country.
